## My process

- Started out with HTML only until every element was on screen
- Applied general styles to * and body tags
- Applied specific styles to specific tags and styles
- Adapted the width to fit correctly in different screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to create GitHub repositories and pages

### Continued development

I will continue learning ways to center vertically since the method I use normally doesn't work to center entire sections.
